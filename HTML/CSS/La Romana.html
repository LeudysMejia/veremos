 <blockquote>
   The city of La Romana was founded in 1897, when a concession was granted to a Cuban firm by the National Congress to establish an oil refinery. In its origins, La Romana was a decaying city with no future for its inhabitants. This changed from the year 1917 thanks to the construction of a large mill (owned by Italians emigrated from the region of Rome, Lazio) that made it possible to obtain sugar from the cane of the large plantations that still surround today. The Roman. It should not be forgotten that currently, after tourism, the sugar industry is the one that generates the most income for the population. The commissioning of the sugar mill coincided with the rise in sugar prices around the world, which caused the sugar entrepreneurs to need a lot of labor, taken advantage of by many poor Dominican families from the interior who moved to La Romana in looking for a better life
