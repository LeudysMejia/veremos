          <b> Rural Community Tourism </b>represents an opportunity 
           for income generation and development for <strong>rural communities</strong> located 
           near <b>tourist attractions</b> and that still do not benefit economically 
           from visitors to the area.Different interventions to promote rural 
           community tourism already existing in the Latin American region have 
           certain weaknesses that affect a lack of appropriation of marketing by
           local populations and tour operators, as well as limitations regarding 
           sustainability. At the same time, there are limitations that are still 
           present in other public and private actors in terms of promoting 
           community tourism and the potential of Public-Private-Community Alliances 
           in this area.

          <b>Community rural tourism</b> is increasingly being used by development
          agencies and NGOs as a development strategy, as well as by the local
          public sector in terms of land, resource and heritage management.
         This publication is part of the series ‘ROUTES: The commitment to inclusive 
         <strong>tourism in Latin America’</strong>. Thanks to her we want to disseminate and publicize the RUTAS program, its main characteristics and the results achieved at the end of the intervention.
         With the aim of being able to help other organizations to develop <b>community rural tourism programs. </b>
